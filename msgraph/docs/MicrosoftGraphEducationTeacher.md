## Methods

### NewMicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher

`func NewMicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher() *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher`

NewMicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher instantiates a new MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewMicrosoftGraphEducationTeacherWithDefaults

`func NewMicrosoftGraphEducationTeacherWithDefaults() *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher`

NewMicrosoftGraphEducationTeacherWithDefaults instantiates a new MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetExternalId

`func (o *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher) GetExternalId() string`

GetExternalId returns the ExternalId field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetExternalIdOk

`func (o *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher) GetExternalIdOk() (*string, bool)`

GetExternalIdOk returns a tuple with the ExternalId field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetExternalId

`func (o *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher) SetExternalId(v string)`

SetExternalId sets ExternalId field to given value.

### HasExternalId

`func (o *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher) HasExternalId() bool`

HasExternalId returns a boolean if a field has been set.

### SetExternalIdNil

`func (o *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher) SetExternalIdNil(b bool)`

 SetExternalIdNil sets the value for ExternalId to be an explicit nil

### UnsetExternalId
`func (o *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher) UnsetExternalId()`

UnsetExternalId ensures that no value is present for ExternalId, not even an explicit nil
### GetTeacherNumber

`func (o *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher) GetTeacherNumber() string`

GetTeacherNumber returns the TeacherNumber field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetTeacherNumberOk

`func (o *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher) GetTeacherNumberOk() (*string, bool)`

GetTeacherNumberOk returns a tuple with the TeacherNumber field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetTeacherNumber

`func (o *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher) SetTeacherNumber(v string)`

SetTeacherNumber sets TeacherNumber field to given value.

### HasTeacherNumber

`func (o *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher) HasTeacherNumber() bool`

HasTeacherNumber returns a boolean if a field has been set.

### SetTeacherNumberNil

`func (o *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher) SetTeacherNumberNil(b bool)`

 SetTeacherNumberNil sets the value for TeacherNumber to be an explicit nil

### UnsetTeacherNumber
`func (o *MicrosoftGraphEducationTeacher) UnsetTeacherNumber()`

UnsetTeacherNumber ensures that no value is present for TeacherNumber, not even an explicit nil
